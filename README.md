Feature detection script for final project EE576: Computer Vision

This script implements feature detection algorithms for determining if an image
of a mole is malignant or benign. This script was coupled with a trained convolutional neural network
to determine if an image of a mole was melanoma 

Feature detection functions:
asymmetry
border irregularity
border compactness
color variance
